# Simulate A Real-world Server Migration By Converting A VMWare Virtual Machine To An AWS EC2 Instance Using The Server Migration Service
The Server Migration Service facilitates the transfer of virtual machines from on-premises to the cloud. VMware vSphere, Microsoft Hyper-V/SCVMM, and Azure virtual machines are all supported. A server may be moved from on-premises to the cloud for a variety of reasons. Perhaps the organization is growing and need additional resources, or the server is no longer capable of handling the existing workload. In some circumstances, a firm may discover that migrating to the cloud allows them to save money on IT expenses
