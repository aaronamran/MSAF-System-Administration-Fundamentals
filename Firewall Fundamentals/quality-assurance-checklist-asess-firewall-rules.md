# Produce A Quality Assurance Checklist To Assess Firewall Rules Against Security Best Practices


## Tasks
- Create a checklist to perform firewall health check. Make sure the following six (6) domains are covered:
  - Physical platform parameters
  - Rulebase best practices
  - Logging
  - Access Control
  - Patching
  - Backups
- Tests: List the test you would perform for each of the domain
- Describe how to assess each test
- Tickboxes: Ensure that each item has a tickbox to track whether it's been tested or not
- Status: Include a column to note whether a test was performed or not
- Results: Include a column to note the results of each test
- Remarks: Include a column to note any remark, observation or comment worthwhile capturing
- Present your checklist in a table (either using a Word editor or a spreadsheet)
- Your checklist must have at least 20 items


## Guidelines
- Tickboxes: Ensure that every item in your checklist has a tickbox. Users must be able to tick items are they go!
- Numbering: Ensure that every item is numbered. This reading aid makes checklist easier to use
- Results: Ensure that users can note the results of items. For example: PASS, FAIL, or PARTIALLY PASS
- Remarks and Comments: Ensure that users can enter remarks and/or comments. For example, if an item is failed, then users must be able to explain why
- Categories: Items should be grouped and categorized logically
- Visual Aids: Help the reader rapidly understand the checklist using visual aids such as color coding and headings
