# Use Cisco Packet Tracer To Create A Dynamic Network For Medium-Size Organisation Of 1000 Employees And Employ Cybersecurity Best Practices
Packet Tracer is a cross-platform visual simulation tool designed by Cisco Systems. Packet Tracer allows users to create network topologies and imitate modern computer networks


## Tasks
- Download and install Cisco Packet Tracer
- Setup a firewall and configure multilayer switch with its own subnet behind firewall
- Create VLAN1 with two servers and VLAN2 with two workstations
- Deploy two VLANs behind the switch
- Create a DMZ environment with a simple web server in it
- Create an IPSec tunnel between your network and a remote site
- In your network, create a secure guest Wi-Fi with a separate switch and router
- Setup a connection to reach the Internet from your network


## Benchmarks
- Demonstrate that all links are green in your network
- Run 'traceroute' command on your IPSec tunnel and show you can reach the remote locations
- Run 'traceroute' command on your VLANs to show a connection from each end of the network segment


## Practical Approach
