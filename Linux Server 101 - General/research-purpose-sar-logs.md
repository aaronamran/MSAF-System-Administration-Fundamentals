# Research And Explain The Purpose Of SAR Logs
System Activity Reporter (SAR) is used to monitor real-time performance on various Linux subsystems.

SAR has the ability to collect performance data on an on-going basis, storing them and making a historical analysis to identify issues on the Linux systems.

## Tasks
- Explain why it is important to generate and retain SAR logs
- List at least 8 statistics that SAR logs can log
- For each statistic, explain why it is important for them to be logged
